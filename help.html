<h2>Job states</h2>
<dl>
<dt>d(eletion)</dt>
<dd>qdel has been used to initiate job deletion.</dd>
<dt>t(ransfering)</dt>
<dd>Job is about to be executed.</dd>
<dt>r(unning)</dt>
<dd>Job is executing.</dd>
<dt>s(uspended)</dt>
<dd>Job has been suspended via  the  qmod(1)  command.</dd>
<dt>S(uspended)</dt>
<dd>The queue containing the job is suspended and therefore the
          job is also suspended.</dd>
<dt>T(hreshold)</dt>
<dd>At least one suspend threshold of  the
          corresponding  queue  was  exceeded  and  the job has been suspended as a
          consequence.</dd>
<dt>R(estarted)</dt>
<dd>The job was restarted. This can be caused by  a
          job  migration  or  because of one of the reasons described in the -r section of the qsub(1) command.</dd>
<dt>w(aiting)</dt>
<dd>Job is pending and waiting to be executed.</dd>
<dt>h(old)</dt>
<dd>The job is currently not eligible for execution due to a hold state assigned to it via qhold(1), qalter(1) or the qsub(1) -h option or  the job is waiting for completion of the  jobs  to  which
          job  dependencies  have  been  assigned  to  the job via the -hold_jid or -hold_jid-ad options of
          qsub(1) or qalter(1).</dd>
<dt>E(rror)</dt>
<dd>The pending job couldn’t be started due to  job  properties.  The
          reason for the job error is shown by the qstat(1) -j job_list option.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Queue states</h2>
<dl>
<dt>a(larm)</dt>
<dd>At least one of the load thresholds defined in the load_thresholds list of
       the queue configuration (see queue_conf(5)) is currently exceeded, which  prevents  from  scheduling
       further jobs to that queue.</dd>
<dt>A(larm)</dt>
<dd>At least one of the suspend thresholds of the
       queue (see queue_conf(5)) is currently exceeded. This will result in  jobs  running  in  that  queue
       being successively suspended until no threshold is violated.</dd>
<dt>s(uspended)</dt>
<dd>The queue has been suspended via the qmod(1) command or qmon. This results in the suspension of all jobs executing in that queue</dd>
<dt>d(isabled)</dt>
<dd>The queue has been disabled via the qmod(1) command or qmon. No further jobs will be scheduled on that queue. Executing jobs continue running.</dd>
<dt>D(isabled)</dt>
<dd>The queue has  been  disabled  automatically  via  the  calendar  facility of Grid Engine (see calendar_conf(5)).</dd>
<dt>C(alendar suspended)</dt>
<dd>The queue has  been suspended  automatically  via  the  calendar  facility of Grid Engine (see calendar_conf(5)).</dd>
<dt>S(ubordinate)</dt>
<dd>The queue has been suspend via subordination  to  another  queue
       (see  queue_conf(5) for details). When suspending a queue (regardless of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue are suspended too.</dd>
<dt>E(rror)</dt>
<dd>ge_execd(8) on that host  was  unable  to  locate  the
       ge_shepherd(8)  executable  on  that host in order to start a job. Please check the error logfile of
       that ge_execd(8) for leads on how to resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterwards via the
       -c option of the qmod(1) command manually.</dd>
<dt>c(onfiguration  ambiguous)</dt>
<dd>The
       configuration specified for this queue instance in sge_conf(5) is ambiguous. This state  is  cleared
       when the configuration becomes unambiguous again. This state prevents further jobs from being scheduled to that queue instance. Detailed reasons  why  a  queue  instance  entered  the  c(onfiguration
       ambiguous)  state  can  be  found  in  the  sge_qmaster(8)  messages file and are shown by the qstat
       -explain switch. For queue instances in this state the cluster queue’s default settings are used for
       the ambiguous attribute.</dd>
<dt>o(rphaned)</dt>
<dd>The queue instance is no
       longer demanded by the current cluster queue’s configuration or the host group  configuration.   The
       queue instance is kept because jobs which not yet finished jobs are still associated with it, and it
       will vanish from qstat output when these jobs have finished.       This state prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance.</dd>
